## **AGILE METHODOLOGY?**

Agile methodology is an iterative and collaborative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement. It is a departure from traditional, sequential methods like the waterfall model, which follows a linear progression through the various stages of development.

In Agile, the development process is divided into small iterations or sprints, typically lasting one to four weeks. Each sprint focuses on delivering a functional and potentially shippable increment of the product. The development team works closely with stakeholders, such as clients and end-users, to gather feedback and refine requirements throughout the project.

## **BENEFITS OF AGILE METHODOLOGY**

1. **Faster Time to Market:** Agile promotes iterative development and regular delivery of working software increments. This allows for faster deployment and enables organizations to respond quickly to market demands, gaining a competitive edge.
    
2. **Increased Customer Satisfaction:** Agile places a strong emphasis on customer collaboration and feedback. By involving customers throughout the development process, Agile ensures that the final product meets their expectations and addresses their needs. This leads to higher customer satisfaction and a greater likelihood of project success.
    
3. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Agile methodologies are designed to accommodate changes in requirements, priorities, and market conditions. Agile teams can easily adapt to new information and adjust project plans accordingly. This flexibility reduces the risk of building software that becomes outdated or no longer meets customer needs.
    
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Agile promotes a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Through regular retrospectives and feedback loops, teams can identify areas for enhancement and implement changes in subsequent iterations. This iterative approach fosters ongoing improvement in the development process and the final product.
    
5. **Enhanced Product Quality:** Agile methodologies emphasize regular testing, feedback, and collaboration. By incorporating testing and quality assurance activities throughout the development lifecycle, Agile teams can identify and address issues early on, resulting in higher-quality software.
    
6. **Transparency and Collaboration:** Agile encourages open communication and collaboration within the development team and with stakeholders. Regular meetings, such as daily stand-ups and sprint reviews, promote transparency and ensure that everyone is aligned on project progress and goals. This fosters better teamwork, knowledge sharing, and a shared sense of ownership.
    
7. **Risk Reduction:** Agile methodologies help mitigate project risks by addressing them early and continuously throughout the development process. Regular iterations allow for quick identification and resolution of potential issues, reducing the likelihood of major setbacks or failures.
    
8. **Cost Efficiency:** Agile's iterative approach allows for early detection and correction of defects, reducing the cost of rework and minimizing wasteful efforts. By focusing on delivering value in each iteration, Agile helps optimize resource allocation and cost management.
    

## **REQUIREMENT GATHERING**

Requirement gathering is the process of researching and discovering the requirements of a software product from all stakeholders. Understanding the scope and purpose of any project before diving into it is a good practice to reduce the chance of the project falling below expectations after it is completed.

There are several ways to gather techniques for the agile product team, some of which include:

1. Questionnaires and Surveys
    
2. Interviews
    
3. User Observation
    
4. Brainstorming
    
5. Workshops
    

## **REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS**

Analyzing all the requirements that have been gathered helps to:

* Identify the core features that will be streamlined with the software product.
    
* Ensure there are no loopholes in the software.
    
* Identify its potential users.
    
* Develop alternatives to existing features, designs, and ideas.
    
* It also helps to clear out any competing features in gathered requirements
    

## **Why Agile?**

Technology in this current era is progressing at a rate where things are changing very fast, if traditional software development methods like the waterfall model are used then the time to deliver software in the market is slow and the market will be somewhere else after that time which will lead to inculcate changes in it but that's not possible in this model. It doesn't allow continuous delivery and so customers have to wait long to get their product. There are various frameworks of agile that implement this methodology -

* Scrum
    
* Crystal
    
* Extreme Programming (XP)
    
    These frameworks follow all principles of agile methodology.
    
    Let's discuss one framework to get a better understanding.
    

## **Scrum**

Scrum is a project management framework that helps teams to work together. It describes a set of meetings, tools, techniques, and roles that work to help teams structure and manage their work properly and help in the continuous delivery of products.

## **Stages involved in Scrum**

The key stages involved in Scrum are as follows:

1. **Product Backlog Creation:** The Product Owner, in collaboration with stakeholders, creates and maintains a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes known as the Product Backlog. The Product Backlog represents all the work that needs to be done for the product.
    
2. **Sprint Planning:** At the start of each sprint, the Scrum Team, consisting of the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, conducts a Sprint Planning meeting. During this meeting, the team selects a set of items from the Product Backlog to work on in the upcoming sprint. The team defines the sprint goal and creates a Sprint Backlog, which includes the tasks required to complete the selected items.
    
3. **Daily Scrum:** The Daily Scrum is a short daily meeting where the Development Team synchronizes its activities. Each team member shares what they worked on since the last Daily Scrum, what they plan to work on next, and any impediments they are facing. The Daily Scrum helps in identifying and resolving any obstacles quickly and ensures everyone is on track toward meeting the sprint goal.
    
4. **Sprint Execution:** During the sprint, the Development Team works on the tasks defined in the Sprint Backlog. They collaborate, develop, and test the software incrementally. The Development Team self-organizes to determine how to accomplish the sprint goal and deliver a potentially shippable product increment by the end of the sprint.
    
5. **Sprint Review:** At the end of each sprint, the Scrum Team holds a Sprint Review meeting. The Development Team presents the completed work to the stakeholders, demonstrating the functionality developed during the sprint. Feedback and suggestions from stakeholders are gathered, which may influence the Product Backlog and future sprints.
    
6. **Sprint Retrospective:** Following the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team conducts a Sprint Retrospective. This meeting provides an opportunity for the team to reflect on the sprint and discuss what went well, what could be improved, and potential actions for enhancing future sprints. The Sprint Retrospective helps the team continuously improve their processes and practices.
    

These stages repeat for each sprint, allowing for regular inspection, adaptation, and continuous delivery of value. The iterative nature of Scrum enables the team to respond to changes and feedback, ensuring the product evolves in alignment with the stakeholders' needs and priorities.

## **CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, Agile methodology is a highly effective approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. It offers numerous benefits, including superior product quality, faster time to market, the ability to fail faster and cheaper, risk reduction, increased customer satisfaction, project predictability, flexibility, transparency, and a strong focus on end-users. Agile methodology allows for iterative development, where requirements are gathered and analyzed, and the development process is divided into sprints, with regular feedback loops and the delivery of potentially shippable products. One popular framework within Agile is Scrum, which provides a structure for teams to work together, deliver incremental products, and adapt to changing requirements. Overall, Agile methodology enables teams to respond to evolving customer needs and deliver high-quality software in a more efficient and effective manner.
